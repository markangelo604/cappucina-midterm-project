# Team Cappucina's Midterm Project - Carpooling App

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains our Midterm Project for Web Technologies (IT 312).
Our project is an app, a "Carpooling App" for SLU Maryheights Campus. The app would be similar to Grab but instead allow students or faculty with cars to allow carpooling while clients can book to be a passenger. The modules will include the Clients (book a ride), Car Owners (providers), Admin (viewing a dashboard and perform user management).

*These modules will be divided accordingly for the Midterms and Finals terms.*
